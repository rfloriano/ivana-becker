## requirements
You will need [Make tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/). 

If you are using MacOS, you can install these tools using [brew](https://brew.sh/).
```bash
$ brew install make
$ brew install gcc
```

## how to use
On unix based SO, just run:

```bash
$ make run-<folder-program-name>
```
This will compile and run <folder-program-name>

For instance:
```bash
$ make run-hello
```
This will compile and run program inside `hello/hello.c`
